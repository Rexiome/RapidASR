# RapidASR: a new member of RapidAI family.

Our visio is to offer an out-of-box engineering implementation for ASR.

A cpp implementation of recognize-onnx.py in [Wenet-asr](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet) in which it implements the inference with ONNXRuntime. For a version of pure CPP code, we need to do a bit of work to rewrite some components.

### Special thanks to its original author SlyneD.

## Less is more. Less dependency, more usability.
