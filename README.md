# RapidASR: a new member of RapidAI family.
A cpp implementation of recognize-onnx.py in wenet in which it implements the infererence with ONNXRuntime. For a version of pure CPP code, we need to do a bit of work to rewrite some components.
Special thanks to its original author SlyneD.



I'm still working on transplanting the version  from Python to CPP. Please wait for a while.

The model is original from https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet/tree/main/examples/wenetspeech/s0 and tested with recognize-onnx.py.
